            <h2>About Qatar</h2>
<div class="container1">
            <p>The eyes of the world are on Qatar right now. Following the discovery of oil in the 1940s, this small Gulf state has been catapulted from a small fishing and trading hub to one of the richest (per capita) countries in the world.</p>
</div>
 <div class="container1">          
<p>Fuelled by oil and natural gas revenue, Qatar is developing at breakneck speed. Everything from universities to shopping malls, five-star hotels to football stadiums are springing up across the desert floor.</p>
</div>
 <div class="container1">             
<p>Modern Qatar is, for all intents and purposes, a city-state. Over half of the country's population lives in and around the capital, Doha. Other towns and districts are interspersed between oil compounds that provide Qatar with most of its wealth. Beyond oil fields, the country has its share of natural beauty, with gorgeous beaches line the western coast while spectacular dunes surround Khor Al Adaid in the south. The large expense of Al Thakira mangroves near Al Khor on the eastern seaboard also provides a sharp contrast to the adjoining desert landscape.</p>
</div>
 <div class="container1"> 
<p>While Islam is the predominant religion in Qatar, the society is refreshingly tolerant. Expats are free to practise other religions and their civil liberties respected. The press is also among the freest in the region.</p>
</div>
 <div class="container1"> 
<p>While matching towards liberalisation, Qatar has not lost sight of its deeply ingrained religious and cultural heritage either. Alcohol is only served in hotel bars and restaurants, work calendars are very much decided by religious commitments such as Ramadan, traditional sports such as falconry and camel-racing remain popular pastimes. Indeed, much like the geometrically patterned Islamic Art found all over the country, Qatar is a complex, yet beautiful country.</p>

<h1>Qatar History, Language and Culture</h1>
<h2>History of Qatar</h2>
<p>Before the discovery of oil and natural gas, many Qataris made their living from pearl-fishing and trade.</p>
<p>In 1916, Qatar signed a treaty with Britain and became a British protectorate. In 1940, oil was discovered in Dukhan and after the operations went commercial in 1949, the country became rich. In 1968, Qatar briefly joined other small Gulf nations which would become the United Arab Emirates &ndash; but Qatar soon pulled out and became independent on 3 September 1971.</p>
<p>After independence, Qatar sought to promote political openness by sponsoring Al Jazeera, a television network known for its independent news coverage. The country also hosts a large US military base. But its relations with its neighbours, notably Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, have been strained in recent years due to Qatar's alleged support for militant Islamist groups (including the Muslim Brotherhood) and its friendly relations with Iran. Since 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed an economic blockade.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know:</strong><br />
&bull; There is a blue road in Qatar. Abdullah Bin Jassim Street near Souq Waqif is painted blue, instead of the usual black asphalt. Apart from pleasing to the eye, the blue colour absorbs and radiates less heat, making the road cooler too.<br />
&bull; Camel racing is one of the popular sports in Qatar. During races, the camel jockeys are actually robots placed atop the camel, remotely controlled by the camel owners.<br />
&bull; Qatar funds the Al Jazeera Media Network, known for its independent news coverage.</p><h2>Qatar Culture</h2><h3>Religion in Qatar</h3><p>About 95% of Qataris are Sunni Muslims.</p><h3>Social Conventions in Qatar</h3><p>Like in any country, it is important to observe local courtesies. Visitors (both men and women) should not wear revealing clothing in public places. Beachwear and bikinis are acceptable by the hotel pool but not in public places.</p>
<p>Business meetings usually start with handshakes between men and titles (such as Sheikh or Haji) should be used to show respect. Small talk is common and is a way of relationship building. Never rush to bring up business matters.</p>
<p>Exchange of business cards is also common when meeting for the first time and take a moment to read the card you receive because it is considered rude to put it away without reading it. Ideally, your name card should have Arabic printed on one side.</p><h2>Language in Qatar</h2><p>Arabic is the official language. English is widely spoken.</p>

<h1>Qatar Weather, climate and geography</h1>
<h2 >Weather and climate</h2>
<h3>Best time to visit</h3>
<p>Occupying a small land on the eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, the sovereign state of Qatar has a dry, subtropical desert climate with low annual rainfall and intensely hot and humid summers.</p>
<p>The weather in Qatar can be broadly grouped into two seasons: hot (May to October) and cool (December to February). March, April and November are transitional months, meaning the weather is hot but tolerable.</p>
<p>The best time to visit Qatar is from December to February when the temperatures are mild with average highs ranging between 22&deg;C (72&deg;F) and 25&deg;C (77&deg;F). January is the coolest month with temperatures ranging from 14&deg;C (57&deg;F) to 22&deg;C (72&deg;F). Temperatures start to climb in February and by March, the average high is back to 29&deg;C (84&deg;F). November and March are ideal times to visit too if you like warmer temperatures.</p>
<p>Although the cool period is the best time to visit Qatar, bear in mind that rainfall, however scarce, occurs during this period too, and the rains come mostly in heavy cloudbursts and thunderstorms.</p>
<p>The hot period (May to October) is best avoided. July is often considered the hottest month with temperatures ranging from 32&deg;C (90&deg;F) to 43&deg;C (109&deg;F) &ndash; although it's not unusual for the thermometer to reach an eye-watering high of 50&deg;C (122&deg;F) in July and sometimes August. If you're visiting during the hot period, you may find yourself seeking refuge in one of the many air-conditioned malls. After October, things start to cool down and by November, you can expect an average high of 30&deg;C (86&deg;F).</p>
<p>Because Qatar is a small and flat country, there is little regional variation in the weather, although coastal areas may be slightly cooler than inland. Doha, the capital of Qatar, is highly urbanised which can make the weather in Doha feel slightly hotter than it is. See our guide on weather in Doha and the best time to visit.</p><h3>Required clothing</h3><p>Lightweight cotton and linen are recommended throughout the year. A cardigan is useful for the cooled malls while a jacket is a must for cooler evenings during the cool season. If you intend to take a camping trip from January to March, you'll be glad to have packed an extra layer of clothing for night time.</p>
<p>Although women visitors do not need to wear a hijab (headscarf) or abaya (full-length black cloak), loose-fitting cotton dresses that cover your shoulders and knees are ideal. Avoid anything that is tight or revealing. Men should also dress modestly. Beware that bikinis and beachwear are acceptable at the hotel pool but not in public places.</p><div xmlns:fn="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions" id="div-gpt-ad-1492512001379-4" style="max-height:300px;margin-top:10px;"><script>

<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;Qatar peninsula is about 160km (99 miles) from north to south and 80km (50 miles) from east to west. Much of the country consists of low-lying desert but has elevated limestone plateau in the centre of the country. There are no rivers or freshwater lakes in Qatar.</p>
<p>On the east coast of Qatar, there is a large area of mangroves near Al Khor on the northeastern side. The coastline then transforms into large sabkha (salt flats) as it inches towards the southeastern end. In the south of the country, Khor Al Adaid, translated to as 'Inland Sea', is where the sea, together with the surrounding large tidal embayment, spills into the desert, creating a unique landscape.</p>
<p>On the northern side of the country, there are small pockets of agricultural lands used for growing dates, along with some vegetable patches.</p>
<p>On the west coast of Qatar lies the Dukhan Field, the country's main oil field. Geographically, there are several small hills stretching from Dukhan towards the border with Saudi Arabia.</p>

            <h2 id="political-situation">Political situation</h2>

            <p>Female visitors and residents should take care when walking or travelling alone, particularly at night, and should use reputable taxi companies.</p>
            
            <p>Personal attacks, including sexual assault and rape, are relatively rare, but do happen. Sentences can be severe. However, Qatari law places a high burden of proof on the victim to demonstrate that sexual relations were not consensual.  If they are determined to have been consensual, the victim or attacker may still face prosecution for the offence of sex outside of marriage.</p>
            
            <p>If you have been sexually assaulted, contact the British Embassy for advice (00 974 4496 2000).

            <h3 id="relationships-outside-marriage">Relationships outside marriage</h3>

            <p>An unmarried woman who gives birth in Qatar may also face problems registering the birth of the child in Qatar, and could be arrested, imprisoned or deported.
